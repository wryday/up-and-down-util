# up-and-down-util

Up and Down is a card game played by 2-7 people where the hands are dealt starting with either 7 or 5 cards, and progressing down each hand to one card dealt, and then back up to the starting amount.  Players, starting left of the dealer, place bids on how many tricks they think they will take. The objective is to take exactly how many tricks you bid. 

Scoring: If you hit your bid, you get 10 points plus the amount you bid (e.g. bid was 3, you take 3 tricks, you get 13 points). However, if you miss your bid, you lose the higher amount between your bid and the actual number of tricks taken (e.g. you bid 4 but take 3, you get -4... or you bid 2 but take 5, you get -5). Simple!
